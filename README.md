### Description

The goal of this project is to create a Webpack Natural Language Processor tool which evaluates news articles using the Aylien API.

Webpack is used as a build-tool in this project with both development and production environments.


### Pre-Requisites

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

### Installation

- `npm install`

Install the necessary libraries like webpack,sass styles and loaders and plugins and add them to your configuration files.

### Use of the Aylien API

It has you install a node module to run certain commands through, it will simplify the requests we need to make from our node/express backend.You will need to go [here](https://developer.aylien.com/) and follow the instructions to setup the API.

The API has a lot of different endpoints you can take a look at [here](https://docs.aylien.com/textapi/endpoints/#api-endpoints).
